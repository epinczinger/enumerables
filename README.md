> In this project, I rewrote some of the most commonly used Ruby Enumerable methods. It was a great exercise to understand how the ruby methods work, how to modify a Module, practice how to use yields, and procs along with all the previously acquired knowledge.

![screenshot](images/screenshot1.png)

These new personalized methods return the same variable type and output that the original methods of the Module. To achieve that, I had to write some complex coding that overpassed the allowed complexity by Rubocop, so I had to override the CyclomaticComplexity cop.
